# MA375-Project3
## Description
Project 3B for MA375. This program includes a manually programmed gaussian elimination method with partial pivoting. For example, given the equation Ax = B, where A and B are matricies, this program solves for the matrix x.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to local directory containing program via terminal (or CMD) and run using:
> python3 GaussianElimination.py
2. Choose option for 3B sample problem A or B, or user-entered matrix equation.
  - Note using user-entered matrix equation: Enter matrix row-by-row, only spaces between values, integers only (for stability), and enter for next row.

## Dependencies
* NumPy
